## Importing data
```{r Import}
reports <- 
  # 1. Figure out which files need to be loaded
  tibble(filename = as.character(dir_ls(path = "Data", glob  = "*gears*.csv"))) %>%
  
  # 2. Load files on by one (hence rowwise())
  rowwise() %>%
  do(read_csv(.$filename[1], 
              col_types = cols(Participant = col_character(),
                               Session = col_character(),
                               Block = col_integer(),
                               OnsetDelay = col_double(),
                               Condition = col_character(),
                               Distance = col_double(),
                               DisplayLeft = col_character(),
                               DisplayRight = col_character(),
                               Occlusion = col_character(),
                               Percept = col_character(),
                               Time = col_double())))
  # 3. Compute duration. Inside mutate use "lead(Time)".
  
  # 4. Drop "end" Percept
  
  # 5. Figuring out OTHER gear display. "gear24" for fully ambiguous, other image for disambiguated cases.
  #    Logic: if DisplayLeft == "gear24" then it is "DisplayRight" else it is DisplayLeft.
  
  # 6. Convert Occlusion into numeric. First, change "None" to "0" via stringr::str_replace_all(Occlusion, "None", "0").
  #    Then, convert it to numeric in mutate.
